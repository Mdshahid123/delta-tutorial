<!-- setting height and width -->

<!-- we can set height and width in css as follows -->
 div{
          height:70px;
          width:50px;
 }

 note -when we set or define  the height and width for an element then by default  it set the content 
 area height and content width height.

 the  dimention of given element is calculated by adding padding(from all sides) + border(from all sides)
 and + content width and height

 total space accupied by element is calculated as element dimention+margin(from all sides)
