font size unit in css

there are two types of unit

1) absolute unit-absolute unit does not change with respect to the view port size or viewing device
 its size is always fixed 

 exp-px, pt ,pc,cm,mm,in

 2) relative unit-relative unit is used when we have to make a responsive website

     because relative unit is measured with respect to the view port size

     exp-%,em,rem,ch,vh,vw etc

     note 96px=1 inc
