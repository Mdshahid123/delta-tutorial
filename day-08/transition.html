<!-- transition property -it enable us to define the some intermediate state between two state of an element.

transition" refers to the gradual change from one state or style to another over a specified duration. 
Transitions are used to create smooth animations when CSS property values change, enhancing the visual 
experience on web pages by avoiding abrupt or instantnius changes and making the interactions more
engaging and dynamic.

firstly we have to define a final states of an given element then we will apply 
transition property -->


<!-- Key Concepts of CSS Transitions -->

<!-- transition-property: 

A transition occurs when a CSS property changes its value. For example, changing the background color or 
size of an element. -->

<!-- transition-duration:

The time it takes for the transition to complete. This is usually specified in seconds (s) 
or milliseconds (ms). -->

<!-- transition-timing-function:

Describes how the intermediate states of the transition are calculated. Common timing functions include
ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out. -->

<!-- transition-delay:

The time to wait before the transition starts. Like duration, this is specified in seconds or 
milliseconds. -->


<!-- shorthand -->
 transition:property name duration timing function delay

    /* intial state */
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: lightblue;

<!-- Explanation -->

<!-- Normal State: -->

<!-- The .box element starts with a width of 100px, height of 100px, and a light blue background color.

Transition Definition:

The transition property on the .box element specifies that changes to the background-color and width
properties should transition over 0.5 seconds using the ease timing function.

Hover State:

When the .box is hovered over, its background color changes to light coral, and its width increases to 200px.
Smooth Change:

Instead of the changes happening instantaneously, the transition creates a smooth animation over the specified 
duration (0.5 seconds in this case). -->


<!-- Timing Function Examples -->

<!-- linear: The transition progresses at a constant speed.
transition-timing-function: linear;

ease: The transition starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end (default).
transition-timing-function: ease;

ease-in: The transition starts slowly and speeds up.
transition-timing-function: ease-in;

ease-out: The transition starts quickly and slows down.
transition-timing-function: ease-out;

ease-in-out: The transition starts and ends slowly, with a speed-up in the middle.
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out; -->
