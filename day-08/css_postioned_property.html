<!-- css postioned property-by using css postioned property we can set the  final  position or location 
 of an element in  the html document. -->

<!-- top/right/bottom and left property determined the final location of element in the document
with respect to the static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky method. -->

 
<!-- static -->

<!-- This is the default value.
it maintain the normal document flow
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect. -->

<!-- .static {
    position: static;
  } -->



  <!-- relative: -->

  <!-- The element is positioned relative to its normal position in any where in document
       it is also maintain the normal document flow

  top, right, bottom, and left properties will offset it from its normal position.
   -->

  <!-- .relative {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px; /* Moves the element down by 10px */
    left: 20px; /* Moves the element to the right by 20px */
  } -->


  <!-- absolute: -->

  <!-- The element is removed from normal document flow and positioned relative to 
   its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position 
  value other than static). -->

  <!-- If there are no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page
    scrolling.
    top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element
   -->

   <!-- .absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px; /* Positions the element 50px from the top of the nearest positioned ancestor */
    left: 100px; /* Positions the element 100px from the left of the nearest positioned ancestor */
  }
   -->

   <!-- fixed: -->

   <!-- The element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to the viewport,
    which means it stays in the same place even. if the page is scrolled.

   top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. -->

   <!-- .fixed {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    right: 0; /* Positions the element at the top-right corner of the viewport */
  } -->


  <!-- sticky: -->

  <!-- The element is retined in document flow and positioned based on the user's scroll position.

     It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.

    It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport, then it 

    "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). -->


  <!-- .sticky {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0; /* The element will stick to the top of the viewport when you reach its scroll position */
  }
   -->
