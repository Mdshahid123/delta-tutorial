<!-- HTML tables are used to organize and display data in a tabular format. Tables are created using 
the <table> element, and they are composed of rows (<tr>), headers (<th>), and data cells (<td>). 

    Table Element: The <table> element wraps the entire table.

    Table Head: The <thead> element contains the table header rows. 
    The <th> elements inside <thead> represent the table headers.

    Table Body: The <tbody> element contains the table data rows. Each row is represented by a <tr>
               element, and each cell  within a row is represented by a <td> element.

    Table Footer: The <tfoot> element contains the footer rows. It is optional and can be used for 
        summary information.

    Styling: The <style> element contains CSS to style the table, including borders, padding, text
    alignment, and background color. -->
