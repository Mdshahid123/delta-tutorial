<!-- </html>Explanation:
<textarea> Element:

The <textarea> tag is used to create a multi-line text input field.
The id attribute can be used to associate the text area with a <label>.
The name attribute is used to identify the text area when the form is submitted.
Attributes:

rows specifies the visible number of lines in the text area.
cols specifies the visible width of the text area, in character widths.
Form Submission:

When the form is submitted, the text entered in the <textarea> element will be sent to the server with the key specified by the name attribute.
For example, if the user enters "This is a comment.", the form data sent to the server will include:
csharp
Copy code
comments=This+is+a+comment.
Placeholder Text:
You can add a placeholder text that provides a hint to the user about what to enter.
