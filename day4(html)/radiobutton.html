<!-- Radio buttons in HTML are used when you want the user to select one option from a set of predefined choices. Unlike 
checkboxes, radio buttons are designed for single selections 
within a group. -->

Radio Button Input Element (<input type="radio">):

The type="radio" attribute specifies that the input element is a radio button.
Each radio button has a name attribute, which in this example is "gender". 
All radio buttons with the same name attribute belong to the same group, ensuring that only one option from 
the group can be selected at a time.
Each radio button also has a value attribute, which specifies the value that will be sent to the server
 if that radio button is selected. -->
