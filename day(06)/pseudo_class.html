 Pseudo-classes in CSS are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements.
 They can be used to apply styles based on user interaction, document structure, or the state of an element. 
 Here are some commonly used pseudo-classes:

 User Interaction Pseudo-classes
:hover: Applies when the user designates an element (with a pointing device), but does not activate it.

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
:focus: Applies while an element has focus (for example, when a user tabs to it or clicks on it).

input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}
:active: Applies when an element is being activated by the user.

button:active {
  background-color: green;
}
Structural Pseudo-classes
:first-child: Applies to the first child of a specified element.

p:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
:last-child: Applies to the last child of a specified element.

p:last-child {
  color: gray;
}
:nth-child(n): Matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

li:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
:nth-of-type(n): Matches elements based on their position among siblings of the same type.

p:nth-of-type(3) {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
Form-related Pseudo-classes
:checked: Applies to radio buttons or checkboxes that are checked.

input:checked {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
:disabled: Applies to form elements that are disabled.

input:disabled {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
:enabled: Applies to form elements that are enabled.

input:enabled {
  background-color: white;
}
Other Pseudo-classes
:not(selector): Excludes elements that match the selector.

p:not(.special) {
  color: blue;
}
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of using some of these pseudo-classes:


/* Change link color on hover */
a:hover {
  color: red;
}

/* Style the first paragraph in a container */
.container p:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Style every odd row in a table */
table tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

/* Style input fields that are focused */
input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}
Pseudo-classes are a powerful feature in CSS, enabling more dynamic and responsive styling based on user interaction and 
document structure.
