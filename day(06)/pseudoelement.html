<!-- Pseudo-elements are a powerful feature in CSS that allow you to apply styles to specific parts of an element 
without needing additional HTML markup. -->






<!-- Common Pseudo-elements -->

<!-- ::before and ::after: -->

<!-- These pseudo-elements are used to insert content before or after the content of an element.
They are often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. -->

<!-- p::before {
    content: "Note: ";
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
} -->

<!-- p::after {
    content: " Read more.";
    color: blue;
} -->

<!-- <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
This will render as: -->

<!-- Note: This is a paragraph. Read more. -->

This pseudo-element is used to apply styles to the first line of a block-level element.
