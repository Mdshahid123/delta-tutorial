In HTML, a list is a way to group related items together. There are three main types of lists you can use:

Ordered List (<ol>):

An ordered list is used when the sequence or numbering of items is important.
Each item is marked with a number (by default) or another type of marker specified by CSS.
Defined using the <ol> tag and each item within it is represented by the <li> (list item) tag.
    example
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
      </ol>

      Unordered List (<ul>):

        An unordered list is used when the sequence of items is not important, and the items are typically marked with
        bullet points (by default) or another marker style specified by CSS.
        Defined using the <ul> tag and each item within it is represented by the <li> tag.

     
      
            <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Oranges</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
              </ul>
