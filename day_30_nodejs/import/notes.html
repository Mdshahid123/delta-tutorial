# REQUIRE VS IMPORT

import- we can't selectively load  piece of code in our program with require where as with import we
selectively load piece of code  we need from module ,which can save memory

loading is synchronus for require where as loading is asynchronus for import

when we have to use import to load a piece of code from external module to in our program
then we have to  write a type attribute in package.json file

syntax-:  import{sum} from "./maths.js"
