# installing package
1) whenever we installed a  external package then with it node_module folder ,package-lock.json file and 
   package.json file also we get .

2)npm manageses the

3)node_module- node module folder conain every installed dependecies for our project

4)package-lock.json-it record the exact vertion of every installed dependencies including its sub dependensies
 and their version 

5)package-json-it contain discriptive and functional meta data about project such as name,vertion and 
dependenies

let's see the example by installing a external figlet module in in figlet_dir folder by using a command
npm install figlet

note-: figlet module return a object 
[Function: me] {
  text: [AsyncFunction (anonymous)],
  textSync: [Function (anonymous)],
  metadata: [Function (anonymous)],
  defaults: [Function (anonymous)],
  parseFont: [Function (anonymous)],
  loadFont: [Function (anonymous)],
  loadFontSync: [Function (anonymous)],
  preloadFonts: [Function (anonymous)],
  figFonts: {},
  fonts: [Function (anonymous)],
  fontsSync: [Function (anonymous)]
}

6) local vs global
-> local- when we installed the package or module in any dir then we can use it in same dirctory only 
->global-when we installed a module globally then it can be use it from in any directories

so if when we want to installed a module globally then we have to write a command like this
npm install -g package name

after installing a module globally we have to link it if we want to use it in any directories
 like this
 npm link package name
