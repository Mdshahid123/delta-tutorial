 #how internet work
 
 When you request something in a browser, the process generally follows these steps:

Browser Request: You type a URL (e.g., https://www.example.com) into the browser's address bar and press Enter.

DNS Resolution: The browser checks its cache to see if it has the IP address for www.example.com. If not, it sends a 
DNS (Domain Name System) query to a DNS server. The DNS server resolves the domain name (www.example.com) to its 
corresponding IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.1).

ISP and Routing: Once the browser has the IP address, it sends an HTTP request to the server associated with that
 IP address. The request typically goes through your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and may traverse several routers 
 on the internet, following the best available path to reach the server.

Server Processing: The HTTP request arrives at the web server hosting www.example.com. The server processes the request, 
which may involve accessing files, running scripts, querying databases, etc.

Server Response: The server generates an HTTP response, which includes the requested content (such as HTML, CSS,
 JavaScript, images, etc.) along with a status code (indicating success, failure, redirection, etc.).

Response to Browser: The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser through the same network path it came from.

Browser Rendering: The browser receives the response, interprets the HTML, executes any embedded scripts 
(like JavaScript), and displays the content (text, images, videos, etc.) on your screen.

Each step in this process ensures that your browser can retrieve and display web content accurately
and efficiently. DNS resolution plays a crucial role in translating human-readable domain names into
machine-readable IP addresses, enabling seamless communication between browsers and servers across the internet.


# what is webdevelopment

The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.
Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.

Web Development can be classified into two ways:

Frontend Development
Backend Development

Frontend Development
T  he part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as 
  the ‘client side’ of the application.


Popular Frontend Technologies

HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages
using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process 
of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications.

It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites 
are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets,
and Phones).
