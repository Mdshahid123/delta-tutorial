<!-- heading tag in html -->

Heading tags in HTML are used to define headings or subheadings within a document. They are important for structuring 
content hierarchically and help both users and search engines understand 
the organization of the page.

In HTML, there are six levels of heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, where <h1> is 
the highest level (main heading) and <h6> is the lowest level (sub-sub-subheading). Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

    <h1>: Used for the main heading of the page. There should ideally only be one <h1> per page, representing
     the primary topic or purpose of the content.
    
    <h2> to <h6>: Used for subheadings and lower-level headings.
        
    <h2> is used for major sections, <h3> for 
    subsections within <h2>, and so on down to <h6>, which represents the smallest subsection.
